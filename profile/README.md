# Canonical

Canonical is a product artifact creation platform. kindof like GitHub and VSCode but for product managers. Canonical's beautiful artifact editor lets anyone in the non-coding end of software development create and manage product artifacts to share with teammates and stakeholders. 


## Get started

Canonical is currently in beta. See the live demo at [Canonical-Beta](https://canonical-dev-b6afd.firebaseapp.com/) and sign up for your own personal project

## Special Thanks

Canonical wouldn't be possible without the amazing markdown editor framework [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/)
