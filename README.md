### Generative Starting points
All product teams needs are different and one size doesn't fit all. Generate document starting points by typing '/gen'. We've currated product templates like PRD's, User Stories, One page narratives, decision docs, ect then fined tuned our model so that your template fits within your existing product context.

### Keep track of work with TODOs
Product teams cant do everything at once, and keeping track of work across multiple context is difficult. Simply type //todo: to jot down a task and keep track of it later

### Get mentorship with generative feedaback
Mentors can be hard to access, and harder to open up too. They often dont have the full context of what you're working on. With the digital product mentor in canonical you can get realtime critical feedback on you work and quickly re-adjust your approach
